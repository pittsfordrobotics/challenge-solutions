### Create a calculator app for the terminal/console:
Allow the user to enter a number, an operation, and another number. Then, perform the operation on the two numbers.

### Prime Jam:
Allow user to enter number and respond with prime or not

### Fizz Buzz: 
1. Print numbers 1 â€“ 100, 
2. Print Fizz for every multiple of 3
3. Print Buzz for every multiple of 5 
4. Print Fizz Buzz for every multiple of 15

Extra Challenge:
1. Print Zig for every multiple of 2 
> Fizz Zig for multiples of 6, Buzz Zig for multiples of 10, etc.
3. Print Zag for every multiple of 7
4. Print Quack for every multiple of 19

### Integer guessing game:
Generate a random integer and allow the user to enter numbers. Give hints (higher/lower) after each guess.

### Collatz Conjecture:
Given a positive integer entered by the user, find the next number in the sequence. If the number is even, print half that number. If the number is odd, print 3 times that number plus 1.

### Continuous Collatz Conjecture:
based on the result from the first Collatz Conjecture iteration, continue the sequence forever. You should notice that no matter what positive integer you enter, the sequence will eventually reach 1.

### Smallest int in array:
Create a program that can find the smallest integer in an array of integers.

1. Find the 2nd smallest integer in that array. 
2. Find the nth smallest integer in that array given some integer n.
